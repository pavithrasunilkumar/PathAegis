### AI-powered smart road monitoring platform using YOLOv8, OpenCV & real-time geospatial analytics.

</div>

---

# 📌 Overview

**PathAegis** is an AI-powered intelligent road monitoring system designed to detect potholes in real-time using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

The platform leverages a custom-trained **YOLOv8 object detection model** integrated with OpenCV to identify potholes through webcam or live camera feeds. Each detection is logged with GPS coordinates, severity level, and confidence score to a Flask backend and visualized on an interactive dashboard powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.

The system combines:

- 🤖 YOLOv8-based pothole detection
- 📍 GPS-enabled geospatial mapping
- 🧠 Real-time severity analysis
- 🌐 Interactive road intelligence dashboard
- 📊 Crowd-sourced pothole database
- ⚡ Live monitoring and analytics
